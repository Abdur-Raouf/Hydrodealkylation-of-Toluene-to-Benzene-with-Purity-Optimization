# Hydrodealkylation-of-Toluene-to-Benzene-with-Purity-Optimization
Simulated the hydrodealkylation of toluene to produce benzene, diphenyl, and methane using Aspen Plus, based on reactor  and distillation modeling.  Designed an isothermal reactor system and multistage distillation to achieve 99.5% benzene purity using Design Spec and  rigorous column settings.
